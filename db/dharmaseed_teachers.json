The traditional, renunciate form of the practice is the embodiment of simplicity, strength and resiliency for anyone who seeks classical training in the monastic life.  It is also a hand extended to the lay community that says: come, experience the life of the forest, the chanting, the bowing, the serenity of meditation, the robes, the peacefulness of celibacy.  Draw from our well and bring this spiritual nourishment back into your everyday life.\r\n\r\nThe outward structure of traditional Buddhism supports a form of spiritual living that is grounded in honesty, non-violence, and living in truth-all the qualities of inner freedom that are precious to me.  Buddhist practice turns the current of attention toward an inner life, irrigating the arid internal landscapes created by the external priorities of our Western world.\r\n\r\nBuddhist practice also reconstructs our relationship to time and space.  Our fragmented world is suffering from a continually diminishing attention span as we become overwhelmed with so much to do, with so little time and so many options.  The practice allows us to visit our interior landscape, slow down, pay attention to the qualities of time and spirit, to explore who we are, instead of focusing on what we do.  Buddhism trains the heart to recognize happiness, not by racing onto the next thing, but by paying attention and ending suffering.",

      "bio": "Ajahn Liem Thitadhammo, a highly respected and revered Buddhist monk in the classical Thai Forest Tradition, is Ajahn Chah’s chosen successor. He was born in Sri Saket Province, in Northeastern Thailand, in 1941 and took full bhikkhu ordination at the age of 20. In 1969 he began training under Ajahn Chah, one of Thailand’s most beloved and renowned monks. Even today Ajahn Chah’s reputation and influence continues to grow and spread throughout the world.\r\n\r\nLiving at Wat Nong Pah Pong (Ajahn Chah’s monastery) under Ajahn Chah’s direct guidance, Ajahn Liem soon became one of his closest disciples. In 1982 when Ajahn Chah became too ill to carry on with his duties, he entrusted Ajahn Liem with full authority and responsibility to run the monastery. Shortly thereafter, as Ajahn Chah’s illness progressed and he was no longer able to speak, the Sangha of Wat Nong Pah Pong appointed Ajahn Liem to take over the abbotship. He continues to fulfill that duty up to the present day and has maintained the heritage of Ajahn Chah’s Dhamma and characteristic way of monastic training for bhikkhus, nuns and lay disciples.\r\n\r\nFor the Sangha at Wat Pah Nanachat (Ajahn Chah’s International Forest Monastery for training monks using English as the language of instruction), Ajahn Liem is a dearly respected teacher and guide in the monastic life. He has conducted every monastic ordination ceremony at Wat Nanachat for over a decade and serves there as the ordination preceptor or upajjhaya to all of the newly ordained monks at Nanachat. His Majesty the King of Thailand has twice bestowed honorary monastic titles on Ajahn Liem.",

      "bio": "As a monk, I bring a strong commitment, along with the renunciate flavor, to the classic Buddhist teachings.  I play with ideas, with humor and a current way of expressing the teachings, but I don't dilute them.\r\n\r\nSitting in a field of fifty to eighty people really starts my mind sparking.  Since I don't prepare my talks ahead of time, I find myself listening to what I'm saying along with everyone else.  This leaves a lot of room for the Dhamma to come up.  Just having eighty people listening to me is enough to engage me, stimulate me, and create a nice flow of energy. The actual process of teaching evokes ideas that even I did not realize were being held somewhere in my mind.\r\n\r\nDifferent teaching situations offer their own unique value.  In retreat, you are able to build a cohesive and comprehensive body of the teachings.  When people are not on retreat and come for one session, it opens a different window.  They are more spontaneous and I'm given the chance to contact them in ways that are closer to their \"daily-life mind.\"  This brings up surprises and interesting opportunities for me to learn even more.  \r\n\r\nI'm continually struck by how important it is to establish a foundation of morality, commitment, and a sense of personal values for the Vipassana teachings to rest upon.  Personal values have to be more than ideas.  They have to actually work for us, to be genuinely felt in our lives.  We can't bluff our way into insight.  The investigative path is an intimate experience that empowers our individuality in a way that is not egocentric.  Vipassana encourages transpersonal individuality rather than ego enhancement.  It allow for a spacious authenticity to replace a defended personality.\r\n\r\nI normally incorporate Qi Gong instruction in my retreats.

Like most teachers in the Forest Tradition, Ajahn Sumedho tends to avoid intellectual abstractions of the Buddhist teachings and focuses almost exclusively on their practical applications, that is, developing wisdom and compassion in daily life. His most consistent advice can be paraphrased as to see things the way that they actually are rather than the way that we want or don't want them to be (\"Right now, it's like this...\"). He is known for his engaging and witty communication style, in which he challenges his listeners to practice and see for themselves. Students have noted that he engages his hearers with an infectious sense of humor, suffused with much loving kindness, often weaving amusing anecdotes from his experiences as a monk into his talks on meditation practice and how to experience life (\"Everything belongs\").",

She's explored many spiritual traditions since then, including indigenous shamanism, which has broadened the matrices through which she understands the nature of human existence. Within Buddhism, Alisa practiced within the S.N. Goenka tradition of Vipassana and the Zen Soto tradition.

He conveys the Dharma with the blessing of teachers Khenpo Chopel, Lama Garwang and others gone before in a lineage of wisdom holders and enlightened masters. During his formative years in Tibet he also developed a special affinity with a yogi and lifetime hermit Lama Tsurlo, who remains a deep source of inspiration in Anam Thubten’s expression of the Dharma.\r\n\r\nAfter arriving in America in the early 1990’s Anam Thubten began to teach the Dharma at the request of others. Today he travels extensively in the U.S. and occasionally abroad, teaching in fluent English and offering in a direct experiential manner the essence of the timeless, non- conceptual wisdom teachings of the Buddha. These teachings, free of any sect, point directly to one’s true nature as boundless love and wisdom. In his teachings and presence with others, Anam Thubten invites the heart-opening, mind-emptying awakening to one’s true nature that is already enlightened. The transformative power of these teachings that flow from the wisdom mind of the Buddha through teachers such as Anam Thubten is apparent in the lives of many who have embraced them.\r\n\r\nAnam Thubten is the author of various articles and books in both the Tibetan and English language. His first book in English appeared under the title ‘No Self, No Problem.’ He is the founder and spiritual advisor of Dharmata Foundation based in Point Richmond, California.\r\n\r\nAnam Thubten’s personal scheduling and events coordinator is Joanie Mercer.

In 2008 Ann began practicing and studying under the guidance of Shaila Catherine. Since then she has been developing and cultivating the traditional samadhi-vipassana (concentration-insight) practice as a means of preparing the mind for liberating insight. In 2011 Ann attended a 4-month retreat with Pa-Auk Sayadaw and Venerable U Jagara, focusing on the Four Elements meditation. Sutta study is an ongoing source of support and inspiration for her practice. Ann lives in Florida with her family, where she also teaches yoga and works as a pedagogical consultant in distance education programs.",

      "bio": "The Dharma is a refuge and a gift, available to anyone who values and nourishes it through practice.  After working with mindfulness and loving-kindness for nearly 25 years, I have found these practices to be good friends who follow me everywhere, present through all the ups and downs of my life.\r\n\r\nOn retreat, we have the opportunity to deeply experience the value of simplicity, of being, stillness, and solitude.  These are doorways that open into a deeper understanding of Emptiness, through which we see more clearly how our lives and the life of this planet are inextricably interwoven, and that how we live and what we do really matters.\r\n\r\nUpon entering a new century together, can we learn to meet life with compassion rather than judgment?  With generosity rather than greed?  With humility instead of arrogance?  With the intention to include rather than exclude?  And with a genuine openness to what we do not know, and therefore might fear?  \r\nI  believe these are urgent questions for the global situation, and rich questions for Dharma inquiry.\r\n\r\nFor several years, I have been teaching classes in meditation and the creative process.  I see the creative process (in whatever medium) as a living engagement with the understanding of the Heart Sutra that \"form is no other than emptiness, emptiness no other than form.\"  For those who practice Dharma, engaging in a creative process is a bridge between the stillness of meditation and the activity of the world.  It teaches us about non-doing and non-clinging in action.",

The theme that threads itself throughout my practice relates to the tremendous pain and suffering, the challenges and difficulties that so many beings face, and the possibility of awakening from this suffering.  From this immediate calling I've woven the purpose of my life.\r\n\r\nIt is a deep honor for me to come together with others who feel a similar calling of connection to the Dharma to learn about the greatest gift of all:  a happiness inside of us that is unconditional, and a depth of being that is infinite.\r\n\r\nTogether, our practice is dedicated to this effort of opening to our hearts' potential.  To this I bring the flavor of my lineage--the continuation of the teachings of my root teachers, Ruth Denison and her teacher U Bha Khin; a commitment to learning how to live with each other in kindness; and my life as a lesbian in a long-term relationship.\r\n\r\nEven though I have been involved in different traditions over the years, what I love about Buddhism is the simplicity of the practice;  the fact that it isn't embodied by a lot of ritual, or special clothes, or the need for different props.  I love the moment-to-moment calling of awareness to whatever one is doing.  And vitally important, I appreciate the safety inherent in the teacher/student relationship, where the emphasis is on the practice itself and the teacher engages as a peer and spiritual friend.",

The daughter of Eastern European refugees who emigrated to Montreal after World War II, she began a spiritual quest in childhood that led her to India, Burma, England, New Zealand, Malaysia, Taiwan, and finally, back to Canada.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, at the Yangon Mahasi retreat centre in Burma, Ayyā requested ordination as a bhikkhunī from her teacher, the Venerable Sayādaw U Pandita Mahāthera. This was not yet possible for Theravāda Buddhist women. Instead, Sayādaw granted her ordination as a 10 precept nun on condition that she take her vows for life. Thus began her monastic training in the Burmese tradition. When the borders were closed to foreigners by a military coup, in 1990 Sayādaw blessed her to join the Ajahn Chah Thai Forest Saņgha at Amaravati, UK. \r\n\r\nAfter ten years in their siladhāra community, Ayyā felt called to more seclusion and solitude in New Zealand and SE Asia. In 2007, having waited nearly 20 years, she received bhikkhunī ordination at Ling Quan Chan Monastery in Keelung, Taiwan and returned to her native Canada in 2008, on invitation from the Ottawa Buddhist Society and Toronto Theravāda Buddhist Community, to establish Sati Sārāņīya Hermitage.",

Coming back to Australia after a year of study and practice in monasteries, she helped run a Buddhist Centre in Sydney and trained with her teacher Khenpo Ngawang Dhamchoe for five years whilst working as well.\r\n\r\nUpon ordaining as a nun at the age of 23 Venerable Yeshe, found like the majority of Western monastics before her that there was very little care or support for Western monastics, people preferring to access Tibetan Lamas who are already trained. She had no where to live and had to beg on traditional alms round to get food, she stayed with various friends and in garden sheds. She engaged in teaching Dharma in HIV hospices, schools, drug and alchohol rehab centres and trained as a yoga teacher.\r\n\r\nComing to India in 2004, Venerable Yeshe studied for two years in a monastery, but felt a need to make Buddhism accessable and socially engaged, whilst still trying to maintain her contemplative way of life. She met Indian Buddhists in 2005 and has been working with them ever since. Her teachers are Sakya Trizen (the second highest Lama in Tibetan Buddhism) and Ven Thich Nhat Hanh, the nobel peace prize poet and peace activist.\r\n\r\nAyya Yeshe Bodhicitta is the author of 'Everyday Enlightenment' published by Harper Collins and is featured in the documentaries 'life beyond the begging bowl' and 'Through the Eastern Gate'.

      "bio": "I have been teaching meditation since 2014, and the more I teach the more I love it. If there is one thing that I have learned in my years teaching it is that we are all different, with our own strengths and weaknesses. In order to teach well, I need to get to know each student individually, guiding each to tap into their own innate wisdom, offering instruction that fits each student’s unique circumstances. The ten years I spent as a Buddhist nun afforded me the great privilege of being able to practise meditation in much depth and detail. I was blessed with masterful teachers and all of the support I could have hoped for. I spent five years in Myanmar training diligently in the Theravada tradition under the guidance of Pa Auk Sayadaw. I then spent a further five years training in several other methods, and spent many months doing long solo retreats in various caves and forests.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity to practise meditation so comprehensively has been the greatest gift of my life. My passion is now to repay that debt of gratitude by providing the same opportunity to others. Since deciding to disrobe in 2018, I have been on a sharp and wonderful learning curve, reintegrating the challenges of western lay life into my Dhamma practice. Through this process not only has my appreciation of the Dhamma grown deeper, but also my understanding of the students I am teaching.\r\n\r\nAs well as teaching meditation I am also enthusiastic about building community. Over the past years I have been leading Sanditthika Meditation Community in the caves of Almeria, Southern Spain. I am also finding ways that we can support each other wherever we may be in the world. If this work interests you, I welcome you, either online, or in person, or both, to join our community.",

Bhante G regularly leads retreats on vipassana, mindfulness, metta (Loving-friendliness), concentration, and other topics both at the Bhavana Society and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBhante Gunaratana is an internationally recognized author and meditation teacher. Prior to coming to the United States, he spent five years doing in missionary work with the Harijanas (Untouchables) of India and ten years in Malaysia. He has taught in a number of settings, including American University of Washington DC where he served as Buddhist chaplain and the Buddhist Vihara of Washington DC, where he served as president. Bhante G has a strong scholarly background and livelong commitment to dhamma.\r\n\r\nIn 1985 Bhante G co-founded the Bhavana Society and became its abbot. He continues to teach in the direct, compassionate style that characterizes his books and articles. Bhante G conveys a well-rounded approach to Buddhist Dhamma, touching on all aspects of the Noble Eightfold Path. He emphasizes metta bhavana (the cultivation of loving-friendliness) as a basis for samma-samadhi, or right concentration. As a teacher, he is known for his emphasis both on samadhi and on metta as part of spiritual training.\r\n\r\nIn 1996, Bhante G received the title of Chief Sangha Nayaka Thera for North America. This acknowledged his status as highest-ranking monk of his sect in the United States and Canada. In 2003, his autobiography, Journey to Mindfulness, was published. In 2005, the Sri Henepola Gunaratana Scholarship Trust was founded under his guidance. This trust provides educations for poverty stricken children in rural Sri Lanka.",

He then abandoned psychology and worked as a journalist, a translator and a publishing-house editor for six years, while pursuing the Buddha’s path of the Dhamma as a lay practitioner. In 1995 though, he went to Burma for the first time and for 10 months practised vipassana meditation in Mahasi Meditation Centre in Yangon, while being temporarily ordained as a monk.\r\n\r\nHis subsequent ordination as a bhikkhu took place in 2000 in Pa Auk forest monastery in Lower Burma where he underwent intense training in samatha meditation for 2 years. He then moved to Sri Lanka where he spent—on and off—12 years and was mostly associated with the forest tradition of Galduwa. A few of those years were also spent in solitude, in simple solitary huts in the area called Laggala.\r\n\r\nBesides association with both Burmese and Sri Lankan traditions, he also spent considerable time in Western monasteries of Luang Por Chah lineage, where he benefited tremendously from their teachings.",

How can we disengage from our habits of responding to the world through veils of confusion, greed, and hatred? \r\n \r\nMindfulness practice helps us recognize when we are responding to the world from the mental and emotional habits that obscure our true home, our radiant nature, which manifests as compassion and love.

She completed the two-year Spirit Rock/IMS Community Dharma Leader Program and in 1997 attended the MBSR training course with Jon Kabat-Zinn and Saki Santorelli.\r\n\r\nHer current work and practice include teaching mindfulness and loving kindness meditation programs at hospitals and a senior center, and serving as a mentor for students enrolled in the international online Mindfulness Meditation Teacher Training Program led by Jack Kornfield and Tara Brach. She also works in hospice as an RN and Licensed Acupuncturist where for the past 15+ years, she has accompanied many patients and families at this end-of-life transition. In her meditation practice, she emphasizes embodiment, metta/loving friendliness, and energy-based body work (qi gong and yoga). To the ebbs and flows of daily life, she directly applies the liberating teachings of the Buddha. She encourages bringing faith, curiosity and kindness to meditation practice and life. She lives with her partner Thomas in Portland, Oregon.",

Upon her return she became a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist and co-founded The Lomi School, one of the first teaching collectives to create a holistic approach to eastern spirituality and western psychology and to develop mind-body therapies commonly practiced today. After discovering Buddhism in the 70's, Catherine began practicing Vipassana meditation and later taught at Lomi-Vipassana retreats in Yucca Valley, along with Jack Kornfield, Joseph Goldstein and Robert Hall, when residential retreats began in the West coast. She enjoys being a guest teacher at Spirit Rock, conducting a weekly mindfulness-based meditation group in Mill Valley, California and sharing her love of the dharma - the blessing of a lifetime. Catherine loves working at the intersection of psychology, spirituality, somatics and the meditative arts. \r\n\r\nIn addition to her private practice in integrative psychology, she creates guided meditations for meditators and customized guided meditations for individuals and couples - personalized audio recordings designed to stabilize the mind, open and soften the heart, ground the body in the present moment and examine a problem or challenging transition through a psycho-spiritual lens.

      "bio": "What I teach is a reflection of the constantly changing nature of my own practice.  When I give a talk it is not a set agenda, but something that I've been reflecting about. The talks tend to be in rhythm with my own practice.  \r\n\r\nAt the moment, I'm reflecting on the interplay of the personal and the non-personal, on aloneness and intimacy, on emptiness and embodiment.  This process of reflection is a slow one.  I hold a question in the background of my consciousness and then prepare to be surprised, to see what actually arises.\r\n\r\nI enjoy the dharma a great deal.  I try to convey that meditation practice is not a pathway of endlessly overcoming obstacles, but also a path of tremendous joy.  It brings a great deal of profound truth to people's ability to find happiness.   I have great faith in the Dharma, and a bottomless faith in people's capacity to be wise.\r\n\r\nThe ancient traditions of Buddhism are as relevant today as they were 2,500 years ago because people's capacity for getting themselves into trouble, for confusion, alienation and separation is not so different from Buddha's time.  Vipassana, then and now, offers people an opportunity to transform themselves, and in so doing, transform the world around them.",

It is my unwavering  commitment to inspire people that such a life is accessible to us all, here and now. This is what sustains me and gives me enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nWith contemporary language, I endeavor to address the depth of the Dharma, to go into the inner experience by using one of the contributions to the great wheel of the dharma, insight meditation.  Insight meditation is a respectful and healthy practice.  It gives us meditation techniques which, when practiced, lead to real insight into the whole of existence as well as our life in particular.  It speaks to what it means for us to be a part of this world.\r\n\r\nI also pay attention to the breadth of the Dharma by attempting to address every possible life endeavor, leaving no stone unturned:  materialism, consumer culture, livelihood, environmental resources, love and respect for sentient beings, relationships, all the issues of daily life.\r\n\r\nMost important for me is to keep the priority and focus on striving to live the awakened and liberated life and not be sidetracked by any particular feature, no matter how noble its contribution.  A liberated and awake life is the center of the Dharma, and I find that I am simply unable to settle for anything else.\r\n\r\n",

Socially engaged Buddhism is a thread woven through many of my talks-- how can we end suffering both internally and externally?

Have fun along the way. I am quite happy. If you come to meditate you will also be happy.\r\n8. Simplify. Live simply. A very simple life is good for every thing. Too much luxury is a hindrance to practice.\r\n9. Cultivate the spirit of blessing. If you bless those around you this will inspire you to be attentive in every moment.\r\n10.

      "bio": "I am intrigued by how we can live the 'holy life' as lay people.  How do we erase the imaginary line between formal sitting practice and the rest of our lives?  How can we bring full engagement to formal and informal practice?  Is it possible to embody, in our lives, the understanding and insight that comes with intensive training?  And can we live our lives in a way that expresses and continues to deepen our realization?  These questions fuel my practice and my teaching.\r\n\r\nI place a lot of emphasis on the Buddha's teaching about mindfulness of the body.  The body is a powerful dharma gate.  I encourage people to deeply investigate the body and use it as a place of recollection in daily life.\r\n\r\nOur individual and cultural habits, our confusion, all require a sincere and ongoing commitment to spiritual life and practice.  In order to mature our 'layastic' practice, we need to develop a palette of practices: mindfulness, loving-kindness, inquiry, reflection, precept practice, service, sutta study, etc.\r\n\r\nI believe passionate engagement is the foundation of the spiritual path.  Spiritual life blossoms when mindfulness is woven with a heartfelt sense of loving-kindness and compassion.  With warm mindfulness as the basis of practice, our attachment to identity, roles and experience begins to loosen.  As our experience and understanding matures, faith develops.  This nourishes a devotion to practice which further deepens our insights.\r\n\r\nIt is precious to be born in the human realm and have an opportunity to practice and awaken.  May we appreciate our inheritance and bring to life the teachings of the Buddha.",

A review of the CD in Tricycle magazine said, “Decker’s melodies, and her luscious, inventive phrasing, give her songs the power of a transmission”. Here's what James Baraz has to say, \"Listening to Eve’s songs are often just what I need to remind myself of the truth inside. They’ve been a big part of my daily life practice to inspire and open my heart. I love Eve Decker’s music!\"",

We awaken to the sacred ground of Love, Awareness and Joy that was always there, perhaps unrecognized, yet abiding and full beyond description. This Truth of our Being reveals itself as Simple Silence, Infinite Wisdom and Boundless Compassion. The teachings and poetry of Awakening are invitations into the Truth of our Being. By neither bypassing nor transcending our humanness, but embracing it fully, the Love we are flowers and extends across the immensity of time and space touching the greatest and smallest of things.”\r\n\r\nGavin studied in South African schools and received his degree from the University of Witwatersrand. Although trained as a CPA, Gavin early on developed a deep connection with Buddhism, traveling widely to study and practice with a variety of spiritual teachers and communities. He became a vital part of the Buddhist community at the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, MA.\r\n\r\nGavin published a memoir of his spiritual journey, \"In the Lap of the Buddha\" (1994) and a collection of his spiritually-based poetry, \"Petals and Blood\" (2014). Most recently, Gavin joined a spiritual community in Mt Shasta, CA, meditated in India at the ashram of Ramana Maharshi, and continued to teach in his beloved Hawaii. Gavin nurtured a close bond with the indigenous Zulu community of South Africa and fundraised for Woza Moya, an organization that supports AIDS orphans. Donations in Gavin's memory can be made to Woza Moya at P.O. Box 847, Ixopo 3276, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. www.wozamoya.org.za.",

It's important for me to sink my teaching roots into a commitment to my community, to ongoing relationships with people as they practice inside retreats and out of retreats.  What are all the ways Sangha is relevant and applicable to our family life, our work, and our play?\r\n\r\nOngoing is my investigation of my own understanding about the assumptions behind what we teach.  The graduate work I did in Buddhist studies greases the wheel for this type of reflection.  Since part of the inquiry about freedom involves not being stuck in one position, I enjoy pulling the rug out from underneath what we, as teachers, stand on.  In other words, to practice the practice.\r\n\r\nAt the core, what deeply motivates me is my compassion for the suffering in our world.  Vipassana teachings, especially as we adapt the forms to an American culture, offer our society a chance to truly look at the turmoil caused by such behaviors as consumerism and individualism.  Vipassana creates a different set of values by fostering a high degree of self-reflection on our underlying motivations and intentions, both as individuals and as a society.",

In the many long retreats I teach at both IMS and Spirit Rock, I feel free to pass on the deepest pointings I’ve found in the teachings of the Buddha in the Pali Canon. Those are my guiding lights in practice and understanding.\r\n\r\nIt is fun for me to take the most difficult concepts and put them into accessible language, to unwrap the mystery.  So I try to find ways to explore the breadth of concepts like \"emptiness\" -- to see how the entire path can be explained in terms of this synonym for nibbana.  One of my aims is to bring the goal of freedom into the here and now.  This way practitioners get a taste of freedom, so they know what they are heading toward on their journey to liberation.\r\n\r\nThe tools of mindfulness and lovingkindness can be picked up by anyone.  They are easy to understand and they bring immediate benefit to our lives.  The essence of vipassana is ideally suited to western society, especially to the resonance between our psychological turn of mind and our quest for spiritual understanding.",

      "bio": "The more I  rest in present awareness, and don't separate myself out from life, the more I appreciate the impact that I have on others.  Only when I am present am I sensitive to my connection to the world, am I able to feel how important it is to be non-harming in my words and actions.  When I am lost in thought, I lose that simplicity and sensitivity.\r\n\r\nI continually point toward this secret of the present moment, for if I am really present, I don't suffer as much, I don't cause as much suffering, and I am less afraid.  I may experience intense pain or pleasure, but the degree of mental suffering lessens.  Practicing mindfulness de-conditions the habits that prevent me from being centered in the present.  This in turn gives me a more stable awareness, which allows me to recognize my inherent peace and  freedom.\r\n\r\nIt is this taste of nowness--introducing people to the living quality of the present moment and its sense of freedom--that most engages me in my teaching practice.  I find no evidence of suffering, in my mind, unless I remind myself of some event that is not in the present.  Suffering arises when I am lost in my imagination, reviewing the past or fearfully anticipating the future.\r\n\r\nI feel tremendous gratitude and love for the dharma, and the practice of awareness.  Knowing my mind a little better, and being less preoccupied with my internal drama, makes me more available to the suffering of others.  Consequently, I am moved to give to others rather than focusing on what I can get.  In spite of being more attuned to suffering, staying present allows each day to become more joyful, compelling and intereesting.  My desire to run from this moment, by running after an imagined, better future, or away from a past fear, has diminished.  It is present wakefulness that helps me recover my capacity to live with balance and ease in the world.",

An opening of the mind needs to be supported by compassion from the heart if the practice is to be integrated, fulfilled, and lived in our lives.\r\n\r\nThe value of mindfulness practice is discovered in the freedom we find through awareness.  Without awareness, we repeat the patterns of fear and conditioning that keep us entangled individually and collectively.  Without awareness, we suffer.  With awareness, we can see the contractions of the mind, how the mind gets caught and how we can learn to let go.  With awareness we can reawaken to the purity of joy and freedom that is fundamental to our true nature.\r\n\r\nAs a Dharma teacher, I simply remind others how it is possible to live in this world and find freedom.  I listen to practitioners and try to remind them that it is truly possible to be free.",

I feel I'm doing my job when people look into themselves to come to their own deep understandings of the truth, access their own inner wisdom and trust in their \"Buddha-knowing,\" as Ajahn Chah called it, which is different from their intellectual knowing.\r\n\r\nThe Buddha-knowing is a deeper place, underneath the concepts, which is in touch with the truth, with our seed of awakening.  I want practitioners to have more and more confidence in, and familiarity with, that deeper place of knowing.  It is accessing this dimension of our being that  becomes the guide to cutting through the confusion caused by greed and fear.  We have everything we need inside ourselves.  We do not need to look to a teacher when we remember who we really are.",

She has since developed teacher trainings and mentoring programs that integrate embodied awareness with Dharma ever since.\r\n \r\nIn addition to teaching embodiment and Dharma with Ajahn Amaro, she was also invited to teach on Tsoknyi Rinpoche’s retreats in the US and Nepal. It was at his urging that she teach subtle body practices to his students. She contributed movement practices to his brother Mingyur Rinpoche’s retreats and was a consultant for his 2 best-selling books. \r\n \r\nJill’s Applied Embodied Mindfulness Trainings were part of UCLA’s Mindful Awareness Research Center. She was on the faculty for Spirit Rock’s Mindful Yoga and Meditation Training, and she is currently a mentor for Jack Kornfield and Tara Brach’s Mindfulness Teacher Training. She was the scholar and teacher in residence at Kripalu Center in 2003 and is a graduate of the Sati Center’s Buddhist Chaplaincy Training.\r\n\r\nHer organization School for Compassionate Action was a training and service organization that taught mindfulness and somatic practices for chronic pain, illness and post 9/11 trauma in NYC hospitals and at-risk facilities for over ten years. She has been featured in and has written for numerous publications such as Tricycle, Lion’s Roar and the NY Times.",

I see the questioning I do with myself reflected in others.  The infinite loop of my practice and my teaching becomes a self-fulling prophecy.  As I see others letting go of old baggage, it inspires me to continue questioning myself.\r\n\r\nMy teachings, for I am not a scholar, come from my experience on the pillow.  In the first ten years of the practice, I worked on the pain of life, the confusion, how to gain clarity.  In the next ten, I was finding balance in non-attachment; being in life, but not wanting to enter life.  In the last ten, I've been learning how to engage with the stickiness of living and loving.  I ask, how kind are people to each other?  How can we find a place inside that is not afraid anymore?\r\n\r\nWe need to know what drives us and our minds, how to relieve the cultural anxiety all around us.  We need to stop and slow down, to start feeling.  But the dharma not just a stress reduction course; the teachings point directly toward the nature of human conditioning and our freedom.\r\n\r\nOverall, my teachings are very much about self-acceptance, giving ourselves space to do the practice and find our own voice.  My intention is to give people permission to listen to themselves, to become friends with themselves.  Ultimately, this moment is enough, we're enough, and don't need to be anything other than we are.",

This essential dharma includes the wisdom of non-clinging, the motivation of compassion to practice for the benefit of all beings, and the potential for  liberation within us all.\r\n\r\nGiven the speed and complexity of our culture, the Buddha's teachings offer a much-needed means to slow down, a way to create some inner calm.  We need to touch base with this place of tranquillity in order to allow our bodies and minds to unwind.

      "bio": "The method I use most in teaching is anapanasati or mindfulness with breathing.  Breath awareness supports us while we investigate the entire mind-body process.  It helps calm the mind and gives us a graceful entry into a state of choiceless awareness--a place without agendas, where we are not for or against whatever turns up in the moment.  \r\n\r\nIn this state we relax into ourselves. We allow the mind to empty itself of its own content and take us into a realm of silence.\r\n\r\nChoiceless awareness, with the transition into and out of silence, has fascinated me for a long time.  What are the barriers to our minds becoming silent?  How do we remain in silence long enough to receive its countless benefits?  Can we learn to bring thought-free wakefulness into each aspect of our ordinary, daily living?\r\n\r\nAs lay people we need a practice that helps us learn how to live whole-heartedly, to do justice to the many challenges of lay life, and at the same time grow in the dharma.  This includes moving gracefully  back and forth between our daily life and intensive retreat practice.\r\n\r\nPresently, I am deeply interested in using Buddha's Charter of Freedom of Inquiry, the Kalama Sutta, as a framework for my teaching.  In this teaching, the Buddha invites us to question and doubt.  It invites us to use personal experience to test and verify the truth of the teachings.  This in turn encourages us to acknowledge life's greatest teacher: Life itself.\r\n\r\nThe challenge for us all is to question ourselves.  Do we know how to live?  If the answer, in any way, is no, then bring in the dharma and let's see how the teachings help us live in a wise and kind way.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "bio": "I find teaching to be a very deep and powerful \"no self\" practice. When I connect with others during Dharma talks--in the intimacy of small groups, and while holding meditation practice interviews--I am continually reminded to know, and be, in a place of clarity, spaciousness and immediate presence. Being able to offer students such a place of connection is my greatest pleasure and inspiration, as well as the most appreciated challenge in my teaching practice.\r\n\r\nFor me, the real fruit of the teaching is seeing the beauty of a gradual, and sometimes sudden, unfolding of a heartmind into its true self; seeing the variety of ways a person's essential, creative energy of being flows into the world.\r\n\r\nOn one end of the teaching, I am excited and inspired by students who are deeply committed to long-term, intensive practice.   On the other end (and of course they're connected), I find that working closely with people at the grass roots level--in a co-creative process of developing and sustaining Dharma practice, study and community opportunitiies on a day-to-day basis--is equally exciting and inspiring.\r\n\r\nFrom the immediacy of presence flows a wisdom that naturally connects us to the way of things.  This amazing gift of mindfulness provides us with a spaciousness where we can make appropriate, healthy and creative life choices.  Rather than being caught up in our old, conditioned habits, mindfulness provides us with the gift of engagement at its best.  This is the Gift of the Dharma that we offer to all beings.",

      "bio": "Lately, my own practice is moving more and more into the monastic world.  As I teach out of that nourishment, I find people hungry for the traditional, solid forms of the Dharma.  I see people's lives changing when they engage in these forms.  Certainly, as I deepen my own Sutta study, I find the traditional ideas so helpful it encourages me to delve further.\r\n\r\nIn this, I am learning how to ride the edge of a question, instead of reaching for answers.  When I let the question hang there, as a living presence, its very aliveness stimulates movement toward an answer, an opening.\r\n\r\nSome key factors imprint my teaching.  The fact that I'm a purely Western-produced Dharma teacher, without the influence of Eastern traveling, and that I'm a middle-aged Western woman with a psychological background.  Also, my years in a Christian practice now translate into my engagement with such ideas as embodiment:  how do we take the practice and live it?  What is practical in the Dharma, a sort of Buddhist Householder Hints.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, the world is in serious trouble.  We have separated ourselves from all other beings, and  in the process do a lot that keeps us from being present.  It is so urgent that we learn to be present and see what is true about our being here, that we live with kindness and compassion for all beings.  Vipassana supports these intentions and helps us all heal, no matter what the eventual outcome may be.",

      "bio": "I find that practitioners can practice Vipassana for a long time without paying attention to the role that fear plays in their lives.  Living with fear that is unacknowledged leads to fragmentation in life and practice.  I encourage people to look at the energy of fear, for fear can limit our access to freedom.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible to diligently practice mindfulness, yet keep fear at a distance.  Not becoming intimate with fear creates a dualism and complacency that gives a silent nod of approval to living with fear.  When we begin to look at, and become friends with, our fear, we suddenly discover a lot more space in our lives.\r\n\r\nIn the larger picture, Vipassana offers us all a practice that goes counter to the tremendous cultural momentum around us of materialism and consumerism.  With practice, we can learn how to take full responsibility for ourselves, and so pay attention to developing inner qualities capable of sustaining us as we navigate the shifting sands of life.",

      "bio": "Because I've been teaching in Burma the last three years, I've been able to see how mindfulness can be nourished by a culture that supports the ancient liberation teachings and by daily experiences of happiness arising from acts of generosity, morality and renunciation.  Thus the practice of Buddhism and the living of Buddhism are woven together in a seamless tapestry.  \r\n\r\nIf there is anything that is most engaging to me now, it is the desire to bring this sublime way of life into our culture in the West.\r\n\r\nWhat began as a deep compassion for the suffering of the existential predicament of human beings deepened as I understood that we need not identify with our experience.  It is this understanding that has led me far onto the path of befriending others on their spiritual journey.  My greatest inspiration is working with students wherever they are in the moment.  We are all capable of so much more than suffering; once we learn how to be mindful, it's only a matter of remembering that it is the purity of intention which frees us.  Dismantling the myth that we need to be something other than what we are is so important, because if we can learn to be mindful of exactly where we are, we experience the happiness of peace, which is what we deeply are.\r\n\r\nMy deepest appreciation is for the joy of the spiritual adventure.  The purity of mindfulness, which soothes our sophisticated, intellectual, analytical, and out-of-touch-with-our-bodies mindset, is the moment we remember to pay attention without embellishment, interpretation or judgment.  That moment becomes overwhelmingly touching because it brings us what we most wish for, unconditional love and peace.  This truth, this purity of intention is what brings us home.",

      "bio": "So much of my inspiration and joy comes from bearing witness to the unfolding of the dharma in myself and others.  My teaching is most engaging when I'm involved in an on-going relationship with students and having the opportunity, and honor, to see what's happening in their lives.  We may begin our practice on our cushions; and yet, as we learn to bring practice to all corners of our lives, we get a glimmer of the true possibility of liberation.\r\n\r\nSimplicity has been most helpful to me, so I stick with basic instructions and try to distill my words to the bare minimum in a simple, clear and precise way.\r\n\r\nMy interest focuses on how to liberate the mind.  I like to explore and find different ways that are most useful to people.  I'm aware that various aspects of the practice, and the teaching, resonate with different people at different times.  What is that person's experience right now and what will be most helpful to them?  Often the answer comes to me by looking at what has happened to me in practice, and using that experience to help someone discover their own intuitive wisdom.\r\n\r\nIn my teaching, lovingkindness supports the developmental unfolding of wisdom.  It doesn't do us much good to practice in ways that perpetuate self-judgment.  When we come from a place of caring and lovingkindness, we allow for the possibility of transformation in our lives.  Lovingkindness and wisdom allow us to move from a life of reaction to a life of inner resonance with the world around us.  They take us out of a place of reaction and into one of responsiveness.\r\n",

Bringing a loving attentiveness into each moment allows us to learn kindness rather than condemnation, and discernment rather than judgment.\r\n\r\nI feel that it is essential not to make a split between the formal practice that happens on retreat and the informal practice that happens in daily life.  At the core, formal practice and daily life practice are the same.  In all arenas of life we can create the same dedication to wakefulness and sensitivity.  The right place to practice meditation is wherever we are.  The right time to practice is right now.  And the right way to practice is to know what we are doing whenever we are doing it.\r\n\r\nWe can live each moment in a fresh way, free from expectations of how things should be and open to how things are whether we are sitting on the cushion, washing the dishes, or talking with a friend.  With practice, we can discover a current of underlying joy and find that all of life is sacred.\r\n\r\nMeditation practice is an offering to the world.  When we meditate, we practice not only for ourselves, but for all beings.  In meditation there is a gradual purification of heart.  This purification allows us to trust ourselves and to respond spontaneously to others with compassion and insight.",

What started as an experiment with four friends in the Silicon Valley has now grown to a global ecosystem of over 500,000 members that has delivered millions of dollars in service for free. Nipun has received many awards, including the Jefferson Award for Public Service, Dalai Lama's Usung Heroes of Compassion award and the President's Volunteer Service Award. He is routinely invited to share his message of \"giftivism\" to wide ranging audiences, from inner city youth in Memphis to academics in London to international dignitaries at the United Nations; his speech at UPenn commencement in May 2012 was read by millions. He serves on the advisory boards of the Seva Foundation, the Dalai Lama Foundation, and Greater Good Science Center.\r\n\r\nNipun's high-school goal was to either become a tennis-pro or a Himalayan Yogi. Instead, by the third year of his Computer Science and Philosophy degree at UC Berkeley, he started his software career at Sun Microsystems. Dissatisfied by the dot-com greed of the late 90s, Nipun went to a homeless shelter with three friends to \"give with absolutely no strings attached.\" They ended up creating a website, and also an organization named ServiceSpace. Over the years, they built thousands of websites for nonprofits but also started incubating a diverse set of projects that included online portals DailyGood and KarmaTube, offline movements like Smile Cards, a pay-it-forward rickshaw in India, and Karma Kitchen restaurants in three cities across the US. In 2001, at the age of 25, Nipun quit his job to become a \"full time volunteer.\" He didn't have a plan of survival beyond six months, but so far, so good.\r\n\r\nIn January 2005, Nipun and Guri, his wife of six months, put everything aside to embark on an open-ended, unscripted walking pilgrimage in India, to \"use our hands to do random acts of kindness, our heads to profile inspiring people, and our hearts to cultivate truth.\" Living on a dollar a day, eating wherever food was offered, sleeping wherever a flat surface was found, the couple walked 1000 kilometers before ending up at a retreat center, where they meditated for three months. Today, both Nipun and Guri live in Berkeley and stay rooted in a practice of small acts of service. The journey continues.\r\n\r\nNipun's mission statement in life now reads: \"Bring smiles in the world and stillness in my heart.\"",

At that time there was little or no Buddhist meditation training available in Australia, so he spent years travelling in Asia and the USA working with teachers from different Buddhist traditions to learn the craft of meditation practice. Most of his training has been in the insight meditation lineage of Mahāsī Sayādaw of Burma, which included several years as a Buddhist monk. His main teachers were Sayādaw U Paṇḍita and John Hale. He has also trained in the Diamond Sangha lineage of Zen where his teachers have been Robert Aitken Rōshi and Paul Maloney Rōshi.\r\n\r\nPatrick has been a full-time teacher of mindfulness meditation for over 20 years. He conducts residential and online retreats, workshops and seminars. He has studied early Buddhism at post-graduate levels and has a particular interest in the original teachings of the Buddha, before the invention of “Buddhism.” This allows him to bring the radical insights of the Buddha to our contemporary situation. He sees meditation as a physical practice that reconnects us with the felt world of our senses, allowing us to live our lives directly rather than through the cling-wrap of our habitual thinking.",

She first discovered these practices through yoga in her early twenties, which provided tremendous support when she was facing acute anxiety.

Rebecca enjoys sharing her love of the many practices that bring us back home into presence and greater freedom. \r\n\r\nShe appreciates the joys and challenges of aligning the inner and the outer—ultimately, coming to experience trust in oneself and in life.  Rebecca’s passion is to create and hold space for this exploration of ‘dancing with life’ for herself and others, including the dance of work-life balance and bringing wise action to the challenges facing the world. \r\n\r\nRebecca is an affiliate teacher with the Insight Meditation Community of Washington and also has been working in the public health field within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) since 1993.  She participated in the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) professional training program in 2006 and has been teaching the eight-week MBSR course in the Washington DC area since then.\r\n\r\nAs a life-long learner, she continues to deepen her study and practice of mindfulness, meditation, and movement graduating from Spirit Rock’s Mindfulness Yoga and Meditation Training Program; the Spirit Rock Heavenly Messengers – Awakening Through Illness, Aging, and Death Program; the Meditation Teacher Training Institute; and the Kripalu 200-Hour Yoga Teacher Training program.",

Over time I gravitated to the original teachings of the Buddha, embodied in the Theravadan tradition, for their down-to-earth clarity, and important sources for me have included the teachers of Spirit Rock Meditation Center and the Pali Canon itself. More recently, I've explored grounding the dharma in modern evolutionary neuropsychology - \"neurodharma\" - recognizing how mind arises dependently upon the body, especially the nervous system as it tries to meet ancient needs for raw survival. I am especially interested in using these approaches to heighten the learning - the cultivation (bhavana) - from beneficial experiences (otherwise often wasted on the brain) to reduce the underlying sense of deficit and disturbance that causes the craving that causes suffering and harm. Overall, I feel amazingly blessed to have the opportunity in this life to ride the dharma stream and share its gifts with others!",

      "bio": "ROB BURBEA (1965-2020) was Gaia House’s much-loved resident teacher for 10 years from 2005 - 2015, when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. During his time at Gaia House, Rob wrote Seeing that Frees: Meditations on Emptiness and Dependent Arising – an important and influential work that continues to shape and open the meditative exploration of many. Emerging from this deep experiential understanding of emptiness, Rob dedicated much of his time and energy during the last years of his life to conceiving, developing, and establishing a new body of teachings that he called ‘A Soulmaking Dharma’. Before his death, Rob initiated the Hermes Amara Foundation (HAF), an organisation that is working to preserve and develop Rob's vast Dharma teaching legacy, and to support practitioners and teachers who are engaged with these teachings. All donations go directly to HAF - your financial support  is much needed if Rob’s legacy is to sustain and thrive. To join the HAF mailing list and find out more about Rob's work please go to hermesamara.org or get in touch at info@hermesamara.org. Rob was also a guiding teacher of Freely Given Retreats (freelygivenretreats.org), a co-founder of Sanghaseva, an organisation exploring the Dharma through international service work (sanghaseva.org) and a co-initiator of DANCE, the Dharma Action Network for Climate Engagement (thedancewebsite.org).",

My focus right now is on bringing the continuity of the Dharma into the market place.

From the forest of Thailand, where I spent several years, I bring a deep awareness of the healing quality of nature into my teachings.  Relaxing into our true nature allows us to realize what it means to be a human being.  It is here we find a resting point, a counterbalance to the speed and turbulence of our culture.\r\n\r\nMy work in hospice brings a sense of urgency into my teaching.  Working with the theme of death and dying reveals the here and now of life to us, how important it is to open to each loss, change and transition that marks our path.  Life is precious.  We need to awaken without hesitation. \r\n\r\nMany of us crave to be more calm and centered.  We know that life has more to offer than this fleeting material world.  For each of us, the Dharma offers an immediacy of freedom for which we do not have to strive or wait.  In practice, we can learn to relax deeply into the moment and rediscover spontaneous freedom.",

For the next 15 years, he resided in Sri Lanka, where he blended the practice of meditation with the study of Buddhist scriptures. He also made intermittent trips to India and Thailand for meditation retreats. During the 1980s, he assumed the role of a meditation guide, conducting retreats in the tradition of S.N. Goenka across India, North America, Europe, and Asia. In 1995, he began training under the esteemed Venerable Pa Auk Sayadaw, a revered Burmese meditation master known for his commitment to the Visuddhimagga. This text serves as both a practical roadmap to deep states of meditation (jhāna) and a meticulous guide to the direct analytical approaches of vipassanā. Sayadaw U Jagara began assisting Venerable Pa Auk Sayadaw in teaching the dhamma in the early 2000s and sustained his support up to the early 2010s. In the past decade, he has independently shared his wisdom and experiences across North America, collaborating with various meditation teachers. His teachings focus on life as continuous meditation, guiding students toward liberation through observation, wisdom, and compassion.",

      "bio": "My focus in teaching is to provide the support that students need to turn their life to the dharma, to truth, and to find ways to come out of their pain and suffering. The retreat experience is an invaluable aid to this exploration; however, what matters more is how one integrates this under- standing into everyday life. \r\n\r\nI care that students see through the illusory wall between formal meditation and their daily life. Then, what remains is a meditative attitude to all that occurs.\r\n\r\nVipassana practice helps us to become respectful and caring towards ourselves and others. This generates the conditions of mind and heart that allow us to awaken to the truth of who we are, rather than believing in our limited assumptions. As we see the impersonal nature of our own mind, we then experience a deep engagement with life that allows for a complete transformation of the heart. When we know this deeply, we can no longer unconsciously engage in actions that will lead to suffering and the ongoing destruction of our planet.\r\n\r\nAs a teacher, I am accessible and able to meet people at an intimate level. I am interested in how the language that we use can show where we are holding on. I look to the concepts about reality that people believe in as the key that unlocks the door to liberating insight. People can easily discount their experiences and forget that they hold the seeds to liberation, that the wisdom is already within them.  As people speak what is in their hearts, affirmation brings about the confidence needed to take the next step, which can often seem confusing and daunting as one walks into the unknown territory of the mind.",

Today there is a tremendous upsurge of interest in a new kind of faith, based on a practice where people can experience a direct spirituality, one without rigid dogma or compulsory belief in a specific cosmology.  This is a spirituality that rests on personal transformation.\r\n\r\nVipassana allows us to take a method of mind training and craft a way of life that is more compassionate, more ethical and more powerful than our unawakened lives.  The Buddha's teachings give us an immediate experience of what we can do to change.  Faith in the teachings means we align ourselves with a vision of our greatest possibilities.

Given the pace of our culture and the direction in which it is going, mindfulness is essential to sanity.  Since my first vipassana retreat in 1975, I've experienced the wisdom of sanity, peace and freedom.\r\n\r\nNow, the challenge in sharing the dhamma is to translate the Buddha's understanding into an idiom that speaks to the whole of our lives.  As practice matures, the focus in guiding others shifts from informing the skeptic, inspiring the depressed and doubtful, soothing the suffering, energizing the lazy, cautioning the ambitious to discovering the subtler sources of suffering and happiness in our understanding and behavior.  With deepening vipassana insight, students joyfully and confidently disentangle their minds.\r\n\r\nIn all of this, what sustains me as a teacher is the unwavering confidence that mindfulness is the source of our healing, sanity and freedom.  Vipassana practice offers us a perspective on reality that is liberating, both personally and at every level of human interaction.  Initially, my unwavering commitment was to the practice.  Now my commitment includes service in sharing the dhamma and wherever possible informing, inspiring and encouraging others in the practice.",

      "bio": "The millennium question I hear students asking is how they can integrate the path of self-liberation with the path of paying attention to the welfare of others.  My focus is guiding practitioners to do both.  The dharmic brilliance is that liberation, the core teaching, creates a deep, transformative experience of who we are, which, in turn, transforms our care for the state of all beings everywhere.\r\n\r\nI love storytelling as a vehicle for the dharma.  I find that creating a non-ordinary reality of time and place carries the Buddhist spirit beneath the intellect and straight into the heart.  Since we are all on a mythic journey inside the story of our lives, creating a timeless dimension through storytelling fires up our natural wisdom and compassion.\r\n\r\nOne of my deepest passions is engaging with an earth dharma.  Dharmic awareness gives us a way to create a profound relationship to the land.  We can learn to show care, honor and respect,  loving the environment as the true extension of our hearts and minds that it is, feeling one with it in our blood.\r\n\r\nPeople all over are seeking and longing for a sense of connection, community and an inner life.  When we fuse the traditions of the dharma as self-liberation and as compassionate action, we infuse our daily lives with the power of the ancient lineage of Buddhism.  We learn about the true nature of who we are and what it means to lead a compassionate life with ourselves, with others and our environment.",

These dharma gifts include paying attention, practicing clarity and kindness and addressing the suffering of the world--which, of course, includes ourselves.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm most enthusiastic about the first gift, paying attention, because it makes every part of our lives better.  Paying attention allows us to become more clear,  and each moment of clarity is a gift to ourselves and those around us.  Clarity keeps us from contributing to more suffering.  The gift of clarity and kindness also supports a peaceful heart, which allows us to address the suffering in the world with love.  When we practice clarity, we offer the possibility for humans to live in a different way.  But a peaceful heart is only the beginning.  We also have to take action,  go out and directly address the suffering with peace in our hearts.\r\n\r\nAs a parent, grandparent and a psychotherapist, I teach out of the stories of my life and the lives of those around me.  I am especially touched by personal narrative, accounts of spiritual journeys, and how these become vehicles for connecting with the dharma.  I believe in revealing my own story so that others are more at ease to reveal theirs.  Truth talking is a way out of suffering.  Discovering how our hearts and minds work and creating a dialogue supports right speech practice.  This is an on-going primary practice that we can do all the time.  My hope is that I encourage people how to pay attention and to tell the truth by example.",

      "bio": "A pervasive but often invisible source of suffering in our culture is self-aversion. We are a busy culture, and we move through our life feeling anxious and dissatisfied, but not fully conscious of how we neglect or judge our inner experience. We suffer from a lack of belonging: to our own bodies, to each other and to the earth. When we practice Buddhist meditation, we learn how to listen deeply and hold our life tenderly.  \r\n\r\nThe open space of compassion allows us to realize that our thoughts and emotions are not who we are; they are waves in our ocean. This gives us the freedom to live more wisely and love more fully.\r\n\r\nFor over thirty-five years, I've been exploring the awakening of awareness with yoga, meditation, a clinical psychology practice and relationships in spiritual community (sangha). Since the untying of emotional knots is an essential part of \"waking up,\" it is natural for me to weave these elements into my Buddhist practice and teaching. With formal practice, and a genuine engagement in sangha, we can cultivate the qualities of heart and awareness that allow for deep emotional healing and spiritual freedom.\r\n\r\nBuddhism guides us in slowing down, quieting and paying attention in an honest and  caring way. Through our mindfulness and compassion practices, we establish a sense of intimacy and belonging to our life. We discover that there is no Buddha \"out there.\" Rather, we realize that our true refuge is the wakefulness, openness and love of our own natural awareness.",

      "bio": "Dharma practice is medicine for the mind -- something particularly needed in a culture like ours that actively creates mental illness in training us to be busy producers and avid consumers. As individuals, we become healthier through our Dharma practice, which in turn helps bring sanity to our society at large. \r\n\r\nGiving dharma talks offers me the opportunity to express gratitude for my Thai teachers -- Ajahn Fuang Jotiko and Ajahn Suwat Suvaco -- in appreciation of the many years they spent training me, which came with the understanding that the teachings continue past me. Giving dharma talks also pushes me to articulate what I haven''t yet verbalized to myself in English. This in turn enriches my own practice. When you help a wide variety of people deal with their issues, it helps you practice with yours.\r\n\r\nWhen giving a talk, I try to remain true to three things: my training, my study of the early Buddhist texts, and the needs of my listeners. The challenge is to find the point where all three meet -- not as a compromise, but in their genuine integrity. \r\n\r\nFor this, I play with analogy. Meditation is a skill, and our meeting point as people, whatever our culture, lies in our experience in mastering skills: how to sew clothes, cook a meal, or build a shelter. So I've found that one of the most effective ways of explaining subtle points in meditation is to find analogies with more mundane skills. Through the language of analogy we find common ground from which our practice can grow to meet our individual needs, and yet remain true to its universal roots.",

She loves the Dhamma and is interested in supporting people in their practice by focusing on integrating Dhamma into everyday life. Her identity as a queer, bi-racial black woman informs her approach to teaching the Dhamma; she seeks to support a kind internal and external investigation of our complex human experience. She has been practicing and studying Insight meditation since 2006, most recently sitting numerous retreats in the Mahasi/U Pandita lineage with Venerable Sayalay Daw Bhaddamanika, and Venerable Sayadaw U Vivekananda, including 3-month silent retreats at Insight Meditation Society and in Nepal. Her practice has also been informed by volunteering for 3 years with Zen Hospice and exploring how developing a relationship with impermanence and death can bring us more fully alive. She completed Community Dharma Leader training in 2016 and was authorized to teach in 2020 from Spirit Rock and currently teaches retreats, groups and mentor’s students.",

      "bio": "Yvonne Rand was a meditation teacher and lay householder priest\r\nin the Soto Zen Buddhist tradition, active from 1972 until her\r\ndeath in 2020. She started her studies in Eastern religion while\r\nan undergraduate at Stanford University, where she majored in\r\nChinese intellectual history.\r\nRand became a close student of Shunryu Suzuki Roshi in 1966,\r\nserved as his personal assistant and advisor, and with his wife\r\nMitsu Suzuki, cared for him through his dying and death in 1971.\r\nShe was a founder of the San Francisco Zen Center, was ordained\r\nas a priest there, served on the board of directors for many\r\nyears, and continued to practice and teach there for many years.\r\nShe studied with Dainin Katagiri Roshi and received dharma\r\ntransmission from him in 1989. In the course of her career, her\r\nprofound interest in the Dharma led her to study closely with\r\nnotable teachers in various Buddhist traditions, including\r\nRinzai Zen with Maureen Stuart Roshi and Shodo Harada Roshi;\r\nTheravada Buddhism with Ven. Henepola Gunaratana and Achan\r\nSumedho; and the Himalayan Buddhist tradition with His Holiness\r\nthe Dalai Lama, Lama Anagarika Govinda, and Tara Tulku Rinpoche.\r\nRand was instrumental in developing a ceremony of remembrance in\r\nthe West called the Jizo Ceremony (after the Japanese\r\nbodhisattva) for children, born and unborn, who have died. This\r\nceremony continues as part of her Dharma legacy, as numerous\r\nother Buddhist teachers have taken it up. Her understanding of\r\nthe inseparability of life and death led her to sit with and\r\ntend people in end-of-life care over many decades. She also\r\ntaught and counseled extensively both professional and volunteer\r\ncaregivers working with the terminally ill.",
